1 Download ffmpeg.exe and place it into "D:\Programs\Audio to Video Converter".

2 Download repository to "D:\Programs\Audio to Video Converter".

3 Delete the 'Test' files from the subfolders (like "D:\Programs\Audio to Video Converter\Input Audio\Test").

4 Get a font file to use and place it into "D:\Programs\Audio to Video Converter\fontfile.ttf".


Your folder should look like this now. Note the location of your folders. If you want to place them somewhere else, the bat file needs to be updated accordingly. (If there is demand I can make the script more dynamic as well.)
